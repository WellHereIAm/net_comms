Prototype is working, now huge refactoring.
    Solve How to use ServerReply, kind now can only at most 255 variants, should be enough, but I don't like it.
    Clean up Message struct, client and server main - split it to multiple functions.
        Make it more adaptable, as now many things are hard coded inside.
